Hello. My name is Nate.

I've been fascinated by technology my entire life, and I'm particularly interested in how it can be used to make our lives better. As such, most of the content on this site will be technical, but I do deviate into other interests from time to time. These include soccer, movies, books, and may even cover political or religious subjects.

I hope you enjoy reading my stuff.  I certainly enjoy writing it.

Other places you can find me on the tubes:

* I co-host a weekly [podcast on Clojure](https://clojuredesign.club/).
* I tweet [@ndj](https://twitter.com/ndj/).
* My open source code is on [Github](https://github.com/justone/).
* I have a profile on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ndjla/).

And finally, if you're interested, my (slightly out of date) resume is available [here](http://resume.endot.org/).

## Colophon

The current version of this site is powered by the excellent [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site generator. The theme is a moderately customized version of the [Hello Friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/) theme.
