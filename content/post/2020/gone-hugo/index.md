[Octopress](http://octopress.org/) -&gt; [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

<!--more-->

It was time for a refresh, and Octopress hasn't been updated in years, so I've decided to switch to Hugo. Builds are fast, there are endless configuration points, and installation is a breeze.

Migrating blogging engines is a fun "yak shaving" type task, so I'll have some posts about that in the future.

For now, it's time to get back to writing. See you soon.
